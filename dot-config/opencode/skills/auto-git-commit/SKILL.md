description: Commit latest working changes to Git repository

## What I do
- Stage all recent changes but always ignore sensitive information files. i.e. .env or any other secrets files.
- Whe adding big binary blobs of unrecognizable type always ask the user for confirmation.
- Commit the changes using a descriptive commit message and include a commit body if there were too many changes or if that would help to clarify what the commit does.
- Also, always keep the .gitignore file updated as needed. Ask the user in case I don't know if I need to ignore a file or directory.

## When to use me

Whenever the code reaches a working state that matches requirements after finishing a new feature, fixing a bug or doing a refactor.
